## Course Project

This document is a small summary and usage guide of the shiny app created for the project.

### Objective

Main target of the app is showing in an interactive manner data from attacks to a group of webservers.

Data is gotten from fail2ban actions, so they are categorized by the action that triggered fail2ban.

It is beyond this presentation explaining how fail2ban works and the nature of actions scripts is private.

## Data Summary

Data has five columns:

- Latitude and Longitude are the coordinates
- Action is the action that triggered ban
- asn is the ASN number of the originating ISP
- org is the text name registered for that ASN

```{r data_summary, cache=TRUE}
data <- read.csv('https://praderas.org/attackers.csv', header=TRUE, row.names = NULL, sep=';')
summary(data)
```

## Shiny App

Here you can see the structure of the app:

- On the left panel you can select the actions that you want to be displayed
- On the main content you can see the map representation of the points using leaflet.
Data is clustered and will uncluster if you zoom enough

## Selecting Data

Use the checkboxes to select the actions you want to display

Click on "Refresh Map" to reload the data

Once you zoom enough and data is unclustered, hover on the marker to see the org details
